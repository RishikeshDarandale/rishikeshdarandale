### Rishikesh Darandale

I am Rishikesh Darandale, a full-stack developer and technical architect with over 20 years of development experience. My background primarily lies in developing eCommerce web applications, and I also have experience with telecom-based products from my early career. I consider myself a quick learner and am passionate about code hygiene, design, user interface, and security. Currently, I am focusing on and learning more about the serverless world.

As a hands-on Technical Architect, I have experience in the design, building, and maintenance of software products while working with small to medium engineering teams. I have also provided guidance throughout all phases of the software product lifecycle. My motivation extends beyond utilizing the latest technologies to achieving product success and business growth.

I am also interested in contributing to open-source projects. You can find some of my public repositories on GitHub, including projects related to serverless GraphQL, Apollo data source for SOAP requests, AWS Lambda integration for SOAP servers, a tool to describe AWS VPC resources, and a utility to deploy static websites to S3, Lambda, etc..

You can also find me on X (formerly Twitter) as @RishiDarandale and view my personal page at https://rishikeshdarandale.github.io/. I believe in learning > implementing
